# CausalInferenceRDIT

## Description
Here we present the downstream analysis for the paper "ï»¿Causal inference of drug effects on metabolomics and proteomics in UK Biobank". 

## Content
This repository contains code to aggregate and process omics biomarkers for each methods  (0data_processing) and reproduce the analyses (1run_models) in the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).

- Aggregating the metabolomic states from models on the 22 independent recruitment centres of the UK Biobank.
- Standardizing and evaluating the metabolomic states by fitting linear COX Proportional Hazard models.
- Analyzing the discriminative performance and potential clinical utility with decision curves.
- Reproducing the visualization and analyses presented in this paper.
